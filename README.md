After installing  Java you have to set the ```JAVA_HOME``` PATH ( location of Java on the local machine ) in your system Variables in Environment Variables. 

- Now that you have Java you can install [maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and follow the setup process given [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). After following this setup you have to set the ```MAVEN_HOME``` PATH ( location of Maven on the local machine ) in your system Variables in Environment Variables.

- Now we have Java and Maven we need an IDE to develop our project the IDE I chose for this project is Visual Studio Code for Enterprise Java and Web Developers, we can also use Intelij or Eclipse IDE.

- Now that all the setup is done we can start the Development by cloning the git repo into the system

  ```Bash
    git clone  https://github.com/m-yugi/Friendship-Calculator-.git
  ```

After cloning the repo we can open the project in Eclipse and start developing 

- Now we need a Tomcat server to run the code, So to install Tomcat we can go to [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi) and install the version needed.

- We also need a database to store the information we get from the webpage, In this project I used [MySQL server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)  and [workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)(optional).

- This will conclude the how to install and run this project
